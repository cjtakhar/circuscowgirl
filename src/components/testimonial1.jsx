            Kansas was able to show our young riders how important it is to be
            in tune with their horseâ€™s feelings about a situaIon and when to
            choose the right moment to ask for something new. The gentleness and
            understanding I witnessed every moment that she worked with our
            horses was overwhelmingly touching and showed even me how much
            horses are willing to do when you truly understand them and work
            with them on their time.{" "}

            I hope that she will return to our barn again so that more of our
            clients can benefit from this unique and enriching experience.
