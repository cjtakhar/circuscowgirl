                    <p className="testimonial-paragraph">Kansas is a naturally gifted teacher who engages people easily in her classes. Time flies by when she's teaching HeartMath techniques. Her knowledge of the science behind it coupled with her personal examples of how she uses these tools in her daily life, helped me to learn the basics of HeartMath quickly and easily. Until I took this class, I didn't realize there was a better way of trying to cope with daily stress than what I typically do when my stress levels start to climb. Usually I distract myself from a stressful situation instead of learning how to deal with it head on. Kansas taught me that there's a better way to deal with a tough situation by using HeartMath techniques in the moment instead of avoidance.</p>
                    <p className="testimonial-paragraph">As Kansas taught me, the beauty of these techniques is that you have everything you need to deal with any situation at the ready. As the mom of young adults and as program director of a small nonprofit that works with horses, this has proven nothing short of invaluable. I have been able to use some of the HeartMath techniques to help a blind horse calm itself down in a moment of crisis as well as help his caregivers learn to relax too or most recently when I took my daughter to college and helped her move into her new living situation. You better believe I used heart-centered breathing to help manage that chaos! I have used the heart centered breathing to get myself ready for presentations at work and for dealing with unexpected life events as they occur. There really is no limit to how HeartMath can help you in your daily life. Thank you Kansas for helping me learn how to manage my stress better!</p>
